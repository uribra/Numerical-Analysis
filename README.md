## ðŸ“š Algorithms Included

1. **Quasi-Newton Method with BFGS Updating**  
   Efficient algorithm for unconstrained nonlinear optimization that approximates the Hessian matrix.

2. **Gradient Descent with Armijo Step Size Control**  
   Basic gradient descent method enhanced with an adaptive step size rule (Armijo condition) to ensure convergence.

3. **Constrained Quadratic Optimization using Active-Set Method**  
   Solves quadratic programming problems with linear constraints, handling both binding and non-binding constraints via an active-set approach.
