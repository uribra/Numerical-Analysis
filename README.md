# Numerical-Analysis
Repository contains some alorithms on numerical methods for constrained and unconstrained optimization. \\
1.) Quasi-Newton Method with BFGM updating
2.) Gradient decent with Armijo step size control
3.) Constrained quadratic optmization with binding and non-binding constrained using the active-set method
